## Implementation Details

### Component Structure

The Header component was implemented with the following structure:

1. **Container**: Full-width white background with bottom border
2. **Navigation Section**: Back button with arrow icon and breadcrumb text
3. **Title Section**: Container title with status chip
4. **Metadata Section**: Icon with descriptive text about the container
5. **Avatar**: User avatar displayed in the top right
6. **Tab Navigation**: Horizontal tabs with selected tab indicator

### Responsive Design

The component is fully responsive with specific adaptations for:

- **Desktop (â‰¥900px)**: Full layout with optimal spacing as shown in Figma
- **Tablet (600px-899px)**: Reduced horizontal spacing while maintaining all elements
- **Mobile (<600px)**: Further reduced spacing with layout adaptations:
  - Avatar positioned absolutely in top right
  - Reorganized content for narrow screens
  - Horizontally scrollable tabs for overflow handling
  - Reduced font sizes and spacing

### Features

- **Dynamic Tab System**: Supports any number of tabs with optional notification badges
- **Status Indication**: Shows container status through a color-coded chip (Active, Inactive, In-Progress)
- **Responsive Text**: Text elements properly handle overflow with ellipsis truncation
- **Touch-friendly**: All interactive elements maintain sufficient size for touch interaction
- **Clean API**: Simple, well-documented props interface

### Integration with Existing Components

The Header component integrates seamlessly with other UI components:
- Uses the existing `Avatar` component for profile display
- Uses the existing `Tab`/`Tabs` components for navigation
- Uses the existing `Chip` component for status indicators

### Testing

The Storybook stories provide comprehensive test cases:
- Default state with all features
- Various responsive sizes (desktop, tablet, mobile)
- Long content handling for overflow testing
- Different status states

## Future Improvements

Potential enhancements that could be considered in the future:

1. **Advanced Tab Overflow**: Add left/right navigation arrows when tabs exceed container width
2. **Language/RTL Support**: Ensure proper handling of right-to-left languages
3. **Dark Mode**: Add theme-aware styling for dark mode support
4. **Micro-interactions**: Add subtle animations for tab transitions and hover states

## Conclusion

The Header component is now complete and meets all requirements for visual match with the Figma design while ensuring responsive behavior across all device sizes.
