# System Info Card Implementation Summary

## Component Overview

The SystemInfoCard component provides a flexible, responsive solution for displaying system settings and configurations in a structured, easy-to-read format. It supports multiple groups of settings, with each setting consisting of a name-value pair. Values can be either text or links that open in a new tab.

## Key Features

- **Section Grouping**: Organizes settings into logical groups with headers
- **Link Support**: Values can be displayed as clickable links with external icon
- **Responsive Design**: Adapts to different screen sizes with appropriate spacing and typography
- **Custom Styling**: Supports theme customization and optional border removal
- **Accessibility**: Proper semantic HTML structure with appropriate ARIA attributes

## Implementation Details

### Component Structure

The component uses Material UI's Card component as its foundation with the following structure:

1. **Card Header**: Contains the title and optional subtitle
2. **Card Content**: Contains groups of settings
   - **Group Headers**: Section titles that organize settings
   - **Setting Rows**: Name-value pairs with consistent alignment

### Responsiveness

The component implements responsiveness on multiple levels:

- **Typography**: Font sizes adjust for smaller screens
- **Spacing**: Padding and margins adapt to screen size
- **Layout**: Maintains readability across devices
- **Touch Targets**: Ensures adequate size for touch interfaces

### Code Organization

The implementation follows best practices for React components:

- **TypeScript Interfaces**: Strong typing for props and data structures
- **Styled Components**: Uses MUI's styled API for consistent styling
- **Component Documentation**: Comprehensive JSDoc comments with examples
- **Storybook Integration**: Stories for different variants and screen sizes

### Usage Examples

#### Basic Usage

```tsx
<SystemInfoCard
  title="System Settings"
  subtitle="Configure system options"
  groups={[
    {
      title: "General Options",
      items: [
        { name: "Theme", value: "Light" },
        { name: "Notifications", value: "On" },
      ]
    }
  ]}
/>
```

#### With Links

```tsx
<SystemInfoCard
  title="External Systems"
  groups={[
    {
      title: "API Connections",
      items: [
        { 
          name: "Documentation", 
          value: "View Docs", 
          isLink: true,
          linkUrl: "https://example.com/docs"
        },
      ]
    }
  ]}
/>
```

## Responsive Behavior

The component adapts to different screen sizes as follows:

- **Desktop**: Comfortable spacing, standard font sizes
- **Tablet**: Slightly reduced spacing, preserved layout
- **Mobile**: Further reduced spacing, optimized font sizes for readability

## Accessibility Considerations

- **Semantic HTML**: Proper heading levels and structure
- **Color Contrast**: Text meets WCAG AA standards
- **Link Indicators**: External links have visual indicators
- **Focus Management**: Keyboard navigation support

## Testing

The component has been tested at various breakpoints to ensure proper rendering and behavior across devices. Storybook stories are provided for visual testing.
