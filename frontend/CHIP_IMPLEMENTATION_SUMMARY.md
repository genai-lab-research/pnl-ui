# Chip Component Implementation Summary

## Overview
The Chip component has been successfully implemented according to the specifications in component_429-15032.json, with enhanced responsive behaviors and improved text handling. The implementation follows Material UI guidelines while ensuring pixel-perfect alignment with the design.

## Key Implementations

### 1. Pixel-Perfect Design Match
- Updated the Inactive Chip variant to exactly match the design:
  - Background color: #F4F4F5 (was previously #E2E2E2)
  - Text color: #18181B (was previously #71717A)
  - Font: Inter SemiBold, 12px
  - Border radius: 12px

### 2. Enhanced Responsiveness
- Implemented comprehensive responsive behavior across all screen sizes:
  - Desktop (â‰¥900px): Standard design size
  - Tablet (600px-899px): Slightly adjusted sizes
  - Mobile (<600px): Reduced sizes (11px font, 22px height, 11px border radius)
  - Small Mobile (<375px): Further reduced (10px font, 20px height, 10px border radius)
- Maintained border-radius to height ratio for visual consistency

### 3. Improved Text Handling
- Added overflow handling with ellipsis for text content
- Implemented responsive max-width constraints:
  - Desktop: 200px max width
  - Tablet/Mobile: 150px max width
  - Small Mobile: 120px max width
- Ensured proper text alignment and padding

### 4. Comprehensive Documentation
- Updated component JSDoc with detailed usage examples and responsive information
- Created specific Storybook stories for the Inactive Chip
- Added a showcase demo with examples of responsive behavior
- Prepared detailed QA report documenting implementation accuracy

### 5. Visual States and Interactions
- Maintained and enhanced all interactive states (hover, focus, disabled)
- Updated hover and focus states to match the new color scheme
- Ensured proper touch targets for mobile devices
- Implemented proper keyboard navigation support
