# Tabs Component Implementation Summary

## Overview

The Tabs component has been implemented according to the Material Design specifications and the provided reference design. The component is fully responsive and adapts to different screen sizes. It includes horizontal scrolling for handling multiple tabs on smaller screens and provides an accessible navigation experience.

## Components

### 1. Tab Component

The Tab component represents an individual tab item:

- Styling is pixel-perfect matched to the reference design
- Font is Roboto Medium 14px with letter spacing 0.1px
- Selected tab uses #3545EE color for both text and indicator
- Inactive tabs use #49454F for text
- Optional badge support with proper styling
- Hover effect for better user experience
- Responsive adjustments for mobile screens

### 2. Tabs Component

The Tabs container component handles the tab group:

- Custom scrolling behavior with hidden scrollbars for cleaner appearance
- Support for optional scroll buttons on desktop
- Visual indicators for scrollable content (gradient shadows)
- Proper indicator animation and positioning
- Automatic scrolling to selected tab
- Responsive spacing between tabs based on screen size

### 3. TabGroup Component

A higher-level component that simplifies the usage of tabs:

- Takes an array of tab items as input
- Handles all the implementation details
- Provides a simple API for the most common use cases
- Matches the design reference exactly
- Built-in responsiveness

## Responsive Behavior

The component adapts to different screen sizes with the following approaches:

1. **Mobile View (< 900px)**:
   - Reduced padding (8px 12px)
   - Scrollable tabs with no visible scrollbar
   - Optimized badge size for small screens
   - Automatic scrolling to active tab

2. **Desktop View (â‰¥ 900px)**:
   - Standard padding (8px 16px)
   - Scrollable when needed with optional scroll buttons
   - Can be configured for fixed-width or variable-width tabs

## Accessibility Features

- Proper keyboard navigation
- ARIA attributes for screen reader support
- Focus management for keyboard users
- High contrast between selected and inactive tabs
- Touch-friendly sizing on mobile devices

## Usage Examples

The TabGroup component can be used with minimal code:

```tsx
const tabs = [
  { label: 'Overview', id: 'overview' },
  { label: 'Environment & Recipes', id: 'environment' },
  { label: 'Inventory', id: 'inventory' },
  { label: 'Devices', id: 'devices' }
];

const [value, setValue] = React.useState('overview');

const handleChange = (event, newValue) => {
  setValue(newValue);
};

return (
  <TabGroup 
    tabs={tabs}
    value={value}
    onChange={handleChange}
    scrollable
    showScrollButtons
  />
);
```
