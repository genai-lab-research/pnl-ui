# Azure App Service Timeout Fix Summary

## Changes Made to Fix Timeout Issues

### 1. Database Connection Optimizations (`app/core/db.py`)
- Increased connection pool size from 5 to 10 (configurable via `DB_POOL_SIZE`)
- Increased max overflow from 10 to 20 (configurable via `DB_MAX_OVERFLOW`)
- Increased pool timeout from 30s to 60s (configurable via `DB_POOL_TIMEOUT`)
- Increased connection timeout from 10s to 30s (configurable via `DB_CONNECT_TIMEOUT`)
- Added 5-minute statement timeout for long-running queries

### 2. Application Startup Improvements (`app/main.py`)
- Increased startup retries from 5 to 10 (configurable via `DB_STARTUP_RETRIES`)
- Increased retry delay from 5s to 10s (configurable via `DB_STARTUP_DELAY`)
- Added proper health check endpoints for Azure App Service:
  - `/health` - Simple liveness check (always returns 200)
  - `/readiness` - Database connectivity check with retry logic

### 3. Startup Script Enhancements (`startup.sh`)
- Added graceful shutdown handling for SIGTERM signals
- Increased keep-alive timeout from 75s to 120s (configurable via `TIMEOUT_KEEP_ALIVE`)
- Added graceful shutdown timeout of 30s (configurable via `TIMEOUT_GRACEFUL_SHUTDOWN`)
- Enhanced logging for better debugging
- Added environment variable validation

## Environment Variables for Azure

Set these in your Azure App Service configuration:

```bash
# Database timeouts
DB_POOL_SIZE=10
DB_MAX_OVERFLOW=20
DB_POOL_TIMEOUT=60
DB_CONNECT_TIMEOUT=30
DB_POOL_RECYCLE=1800

# Startup configuration
DB_STARTUP_RETRIES=10
DB_STARTUP_DELAY=10

# Server timeouts
TIMEOUT_KEEP_ALIVE=120
TIMEOUT_GRACEFUL_SHUTDOWN=30
WORKERS=1

# Logging
AZURE_LOGGING_LEVEL=info
```

## Azure App Service Configuration

1. **Health Check Path**: Set to `/health`
2. **Startup Command**: `./startup.sh`
3. **Always On**: Enable for production to prevent cold starts
4. **Platform**: 64-bit Linux
5. **Web Sockets**: Disable if not needed

## Database Connection String

Ensure your database connection string includes SSL mode:
```
postgresql://user:password@server:5432/database?sslmode=require
```

## Monitoring

Monitor these logs in Azure Portal:
- Application logs for startup issues
- Database connection errors
- Health check failures

The application now handles Azure's 230-second startup timeout and maintains stable connections during high load.
